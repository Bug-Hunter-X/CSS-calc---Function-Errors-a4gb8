# CSS calc() Function Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results due to inconsistent units or errors in the calculations.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` shows how to correct the issue.

**Problem:** The `calc()` function, while powerful, requires careful attention to unit consistency to avoid unexpected layout issues.  Errors in the mathematical expressions can also cause unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**  Ensure units are consistent within the calculation (e.g., all pixels, all percentages) and double-check the mathematical expressions for accuracy.  Consider using CSS variables to enhance readability and maintainability.
